# Hangman Game
The classic letter guessing game called Hangman implemented with React and Sass.

# How to play
You are shown a set of blank letters that match a word or phrase and you have to guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word. You guess by sending a letter from an input in the UI. If you send a letter that is in the word the letter is revealed from the blank letters; however, if you pick a letter that is not in the word, then the letter you sent its going to be added in a "wrong letters" recipient and stickman is slowly drawn.
